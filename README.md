#### Hi! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a electrical engineering doctoral student at the University of Dayton. Currently, I'm the technical lead at [Telos Realms](https://telosrealms.com), an RPG bullet-hell experience built on top of Minecraft. Additionally, I am a developer at Lumine Studios. I am the lead maintainer of MythicHUD and help out on a few other plugins, including ModelEngine and MythicMobs.

The repositories here are mostly passion projects that I tinker with when I feel the inclination.
