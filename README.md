#### Hi! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a computer engineering student at the University of Dayton.
The repositories here are mostly passion projects that I tinker with when I feel the inclination

Right now, I'm learning (and loving) Go to re-write a (Super) Gameboy (Color) emulator that I wrote in C++ but never released on GitHub. You can find that [here](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Goboy)!

------------
If (for some reason) you are interested in something else that I have written, here's a list of everything noteworthy and a quick description of each:
- [Adventuria](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Adventuria-old/tree/slick2d)â€”it's a horrendous 2D Minecraft clone written in Java with Slick2D. My first project ever! Pull it for a good laugh!
- [Stelox](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Stelox)â€”A hobby OS (currently only a bootloader) that supports BIOS and UEFI x86 targets. It aims to be able to load Mutliboot 2-complaint ELF images. Written in the standard C and Intel-syntax ASM.
- [Minebot](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Minebot) and [Minebot-Link](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Minebot-Link)â€”Discord integration for game chat and game servers. It has two components: a Discord bot and plugin for a game server. Currently, it only supports Minecraft Forge 1.12.2, but the bot is written such that implementing another game protocol is simple. I used this project to learn Kotlin, which I found absolutely refreshing compared to Java.
- [pokepink](https://github.com/wordandahalf/pokepink)â€”A fork of [pret/pokeyellow](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow) that imagines what the unreleased PokÃ©mon Pink could have been. It *was* a collaborative open-source project, but the original maintainer stopped maintaining. Still needs a lot of work on the intro sequence.
- [Geyser](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Geyser) is my fork of the Minecraft: Bedrock to Minecraft: Java Edition protocol translator. I plan on contributing to the project at some point. For now, it sits.
