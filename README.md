#### Hi! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a computer engineering student at the University of Dayton.
The repositories here are mostly passion projects that I tinker with when I feel the inclination.

------------
If (for some reason) you are interested in something else that I have written, here's a list of everything noteworthy and a quick description of each:
- [Adventuria](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Adventuria-old/tree/slick2d)â€”it's a horrendous 2D Minecraft clone written in Java with Slick2D. My first project ever! Pull it for a good laugh!
- [Blueprint](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Blueprint)â€”An annotation-driven library for modifying Java code at runtime. It was written to help with a modding API for the indie game Equilinox; I haven't touched it much since. Organization was difficult for this, I tried rewriting it twice but could never settle on an architecture. I might revisit this at some point in the future, though I don't use Java very much anymore.
- [Dead by Minecraft](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Dead-by-Minecraft)â€”A recreation of the popular Dead by Daylight in Minecraft using a Spigot plugin and a resource pack.
- [Geyser](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Geyser) is my fork of the Minecraft: Bedrock to Minecraft: Java Edition protocol translator. I plan on contributing to the project at some point. For now, it sits.
- [Goboy](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Goboy)â€”A (S)GB(C) emulator written in Go. It was mostly used to learn the language, which I love!
- [Minebot](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Minebot) and [Minebot-Link](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Minebot-Link)â€”Discord integration for game chat and game servers. It has two components: a Discord bot and plugin for a game server. Currently, it only supports Minecraft Forge 1.12.2, but the bot is written such that implementing another game protocol is simple. I used this project to learn Kotlin, which I found absolutely refreshing compared to Java.
- [pokepink](https://github.com/wordandahalf/pokepink)â€”A fork of [pret/pokeyellow](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow) that imagines what the unreleased PokÃ©mon Pink could have been. It *was* a collaborative open-source project, but the original maintainer stopped maintaining. Still needs a lot of work on the intro sequence.
- [Stelox](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Stelox)â€”A hobby OS (currently only a bootloader and stub kernel) that supports BIOS and UEFI x86 targets. It aims to be able to load Mutliboot 2-complaint ELF images. Written in the standard C and Intel-syntax ASM.
- [XDN](https://github.com/wordandahalf/XDN)â€”My take on Ben Eater's breadboard CPU design. I used the schematics provided on his [website](https://eater.net/8bit/schematics) and implemented it in Verilog. I had used VHDL prior to this, so the (comparative) conciseness was a breath of fresh air. It's been tested on an Alinx AX309 that I've had lying around.
