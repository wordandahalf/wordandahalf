#### Hi! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineering graduate student at the University of Dayton. Currently, I'm the technical lead at [RotMC](https://rotmc.xyz), a RPG bullet-hell experience built on top of Minecraft.

The repositories here are mostly passion projects that I tinker with when I feel the inclination.

If you are interested in something else that I have written, here's a list of everything noteworthy and a quick description of each:
- [Blueprint](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Blueprint)â€”An annotation-driven library for modifying Java code at runtime. It was written to help with a modding API for the indie game Equilinox.
- [Dead by Minecraft](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Dead-by-Minecraft)â€”A recreation of the popular Dead by Daylight in Minecraft using a Spigot plugin and a resource pack.
- [Goboy](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Goboy)â€”A (S)GB(C) emulator written in Go.
- [pokepink](https://github.com/wordandahalf/pokepink)â€”A fork of [pret/pokeyellow](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow) that imagines what the unreleased PokÃ©mon Pink could have been.
- [Stelox](https://github.com/wordandahalf/Stelox)â€”A hobby OS (currently only a bootloader and stub kernel) that supports BIOS and UEFI x86 targets. It aims to be able to load Mutliboot 2-complaint ELF images. Written in the standard C and Intel-syntax ASM.
- [XDN](https://github.com/wordandahalf/XDN)â€”My take on Ben Eater's breadboard CPU design. I used the schematics provided on his [website](https://eater.net/8bit/schematics) and implemented it in Verilog. It's been tested on an Alinx AX309.
