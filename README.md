#### Hi! I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a electrical engineering doctoral student at the University of Dayton. My research focuses on the design and analysis of neuromorphic imagers in addition to downstream computer vision algorithms.
Previously, I've been the technical lead at [Telos Realms](https://telosrealms.com), an RPG bullet-hell experience built on top of Minecraft and a developer with Lumine Studios, where I helped maintain some of their products, including ModelEngine.

The repositories here are mostly passion projects that I tinker with when I feel the inclination.
